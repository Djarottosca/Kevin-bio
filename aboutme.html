      I am a recent graduate with a drive and ambition to tackle new
      challenges in various fields. Strong educational background with a
      Bachelor's degree in Theoretical Physics from Universitas Airlangga
      (UA), consistently showing good academic performance with various work
      and organizational experiences. Throughout my academic journey, I
      consistently demonstrated good performance and gained valuable work
      experiences in diverse organizations. Since 2020, I have served as a
      teaching assistant and laboratory assistant, focusing on tasks related
      to teaching, research, and community service. In these roles, I have
      trained students to embody moral behavior, attentive listening, critical
      thinking, and clear communication. Additionally, during my time in
      college, I actively participated in various organizations and
      volunteered, showcasing my commitment to community engagement. I possess
      strong communication skills, work effectively in a team, and excel in
      problem-solving.

                  publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is a programming language in a fashion similar to C. In

                  plane wave basis sets, and pseudo-potentials.To run Quantum Espresso on the cluster, first load the
                  Open MPI module and the Quantum Espresso module using the commands.
