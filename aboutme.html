      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="ps-2 font-monospace justify-content-center">
        I am a recent graduate with a drive and ambition to tackle new
        challenges in various fields. Strong educational background with a
        Bachelor's degree in Theoretical Physics from Universitas Airlangga
        (UA), consistently showing good academic performance with various work
        and organizational experiences. Throughout my academic journey, I
        consistently demonstrated good performance and gained valuable work
        experiences in diverse organizations. Since 2020, I have served as a
        teaching assistant and laboratory assistant, focusing on tasks related
        to teaching, research, and community service. In these roles, I have
        trained students to embody moral behavior, attentive listening, critical
        thinking, and clear communication. Additionally, during my time in
        college, I actively participated in various organizations and
        volunteered, showcasing my commitment to community engagement. I possess
        strong communication skills, work effectively in a team, and excel in
        problem-solving.
