          Diesel and gasoline engines are the two most commonly used internal
          combustion engines, although their operations seem similar they have
          some interesting differences and each has advantages when compared to
          the other. This article was created to explore these differences and
          advantages from a scientific point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of both diesel and gasoline engines use a 4-stroke cycle
          of suction, compression, stroke, and exhaust. However, diesel engines
          often have a higher compression ratio than gasoline engines. The main
          components of diesel engines and gasoline engines are similar, such as
          pistons, cylinders, suction, exhaust, and crankshaft valves. Although
          there are differences in compression ratio and ignition system, the
          structure and operating principle of these components are basically
          the same. Both produce mechanical power.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a difference between these two engines due to the way the
          fuel is burned. Diesel oil is not volatile, its boiling point is
          250-400&deg;Celsius, and it does not mix well with air. When atomized
          diesel fuel is sprayed into a room with high temperature air,
          spontaneous combustion will occur. On the other hand, gasoline is
          volatile, the boiling point of gasoline is 40-200&deg;Celsius, so it
          mixes with air efficiently, the result is that a spark is enough to
          produce smooth combustion. This indicates that in a gasoline engine,
          the fuel and air must be mixed first while in a diesel engine the
          mixing only occurs during combustion. This is why diesel engines use
          injectors while gasoline engines use spark plugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a diesel engine, combustion can start anywhere in the combustion
          chamber and the process is not controlled. Therefore, diesel engines
          are noisy and have a loud vibration, to reduce noise and excessive
          vibration problems, diesel engines require a more robust structural
          design than gasoline engines. Gasoline engines are less noisy and do
          not cause excessive vibration when compared to diesel engines, because
          the combustion process in the premixed mixture occurs smoothly and
          propagates well, this is why gasoline engines are always preferred by
          many people for light load use.
        </p>
        <p>
          A diesel engine compresses only air, it can achieve a good compression
          ratio without the risk of self-ignition, but such a high compression
          ratio is not possible in a premixed gasoline engine. The higher the
          compression ratio the better the cycle efficiency is the reason why
          diesel engines have better fuel economy compared to gasoline engines.

          Gasoline and diesel fuels, which are derivatives of crude oil, are
          generally used in internal combustion engines. The approximate
          elemental structure of an average crude oil consists of 84% carbon,
          14% hydrogen, 1-3% sulfur, and less than 1% nitrogen, oxygen atoms,
          metals, and salts. Crude oil consists of a wide range of hydrocarbon
          compounds consisting of alkanes, alkenes, naphthenes, and aromatics.
          These are very small molecular structures such as propane
          (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) and butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>)
          but can also be composed of mixtures of various structures with very
          large molecules such as heavy oils and asphalt. Therefore, crude oil
          needs to be distilled to be used in internal combustion engines. As a
          result of heat distillation of crude oil, petroleum derivatives such
          as petroleum gases, jet fuel, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, heavy fuels,
          machine oils, and asphalt are obtained. In general, the distillation
          of crude oil resulted in an average of 30% gasoline, 20-40% diesel,
          and 20% of heavy fuel oil, and heavy oils from 10 to 20% are obtained
          [2, 5].During the distillation of crude oil, gasoline is obtained
          between 40 and 200&deg;C and diesel fuel is obtained between 200 and
          425&deg;C. In order to use these fuels in engines, some of the
          important physical and chemical properties such as specific gravity of
          the fuel, structural component, thermal value, flash point and
          combustion temperature, self-ignition temperature, vapor pressure,
          viscosity of the fuel, surface tension, freezing temperature, and cold
          flow properties are required. The specific mass, density of the fuel
          decreases with increasing hydrogen content in the molecule. The
          density of gasoline and diesel fuels is generally given in kg/m<sup
            >3</sup
          >
          at 20&deg;C. The American Petroleum Institute (API) number is an
          international measurement system that classifies crude oil according
          to its viscosity according to the American standards. The specific
          gravity can be defined as the ratio of the weight of a given volume of
          a given substance at 15.15&deg;C (60&deg;F) to the weight of the water
          at the same volume and temperature. The relationship between API
          number and specific gravity is expressed as follows [1, 2, 5].

          Depending on the type of gasoline or diesel engine, the desired
          properties of fuels vary. The most important properties of gasoline
          fuels are properties such as volatility and knocking resistance,
          whereas diesel fuels are required to have important fuel properties
          such as viscosity, surface tension, and ignition tendency. In gasoline
          fuels, volatility and knock resistance are one of the most important
          parameters affecting engine performance. The volatility of gasoline
          fuel affects the rate and amount of evaporation of the fuel in the
          intake channel and in the cylinder. The low volatility of the fuel
          influences the formation of sufficient air-fuel mixture, but when it
          is very volatile, it can prevent the flow of fuel by creating vapor
          bubbles in the suction channel with the local temperature increases.
          When the flame front advances during combustion, with the increasing
          temperature and pressure inside the cylinder, it compresses the
          air-fuel fill which the flame front cannot yet reach. Thus, the fuel
          can constitute another combustion front due to the fuel spontane.
          ously reaches the ignition temperature to heat and radiation. The
          combustion speeds of the flame fronts at these different points can be
          300-350 m/s, and cylinder pressures may reciprocate to as high as 9-12
          MPa. At these high speed and pressure values, the flame fronts are
          damped by hitting each other or against the walls of the combustion
          chamber. These damping are not only cause loss of energy but also
          increase the local heat conduction. As a result of this situation,
          engine performance decreases. This phenomenon is called a knock in
          gasoline engines and is an undesirable situation. The chemical
          structure of the fuel has a considerable effect on the autoignition
          temperature. Octane number (ON) is defined as the property of fuel to
          knocking resistance or how well the fuel itself ignites. The octane
          number is inversely proportional to the chain length of the fuel
          molecules. The shorter the molecular chain length of the fuels has,
          the higher the octane number is. However, the octane number is
          directly proportional to the branched side chain component. The higher
          the branching in the molecule chain leads to the higher octane number
          of the fuel. In other words, it causes higher knocking resistance of
          fuels. Generally, increasing the number of carbon atoms in the
          composition of the fuel has higher impact resistance. However, the
          octane numbers of cyclic molecules, naphthenes, alcohols, and
          aromatics are high. In order to scale the octane number of gasoline,
          two reference points are taken, which represent points 0-100. The
          octane number of normal heptane (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) is
          assumed to be 0, while the octane number of isooctane
          (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) is considered to be 100. The reason of
          these two fuels as a reference point is that both fuel compounds have
          almost the same volatility and boiling point values. The reason as a
          reference point of these two fuels is that both fuel compounds have
          almost the same volatility and boiling point values. Fuels such as
          alcohols and benzenes with an octane number higher than the top octane
          number of this measure are also available. In gasoline engines,
          additives are used to increase the knocking resistance of the fuel to
          prevent knocking. The two most commonly used methods for determining
          the octane number of fuels are engine method and research method. The
          octane numbers determined by these methods give the values of Motor
          Octane Number (MON) and Research Octane Number (RON), respectively.
