        <p class="ps-2 justify-content-center"></p>
        <p>
          One of the perennial questions of childhood is “Why is the sky blue?”
          You may have asked this as a child, or you may have a child now asking
          you!
        </p>
        <p>Let&#39;s start with something simple.</p>
        <p>
          The explanation begins with the ultimate source of light in our solar
          system: the Sun. Sunlight appears white, but this white light is made
          up of all the colors of the visible spectrum, ranging from red through
          violet. On its path through the atmosphere, sunlight is absorbed,
          reflected, and altered by different elements, compounds, and
          particles. The color of the sky depends largely upon the wavelengths
          of the incoming light, but air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen)
          and dust particles also play important roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the sun is high overhead, the bulk of its rays intercept the
          atmosphere at nearly vertical angles. Shorter wavelengths of light,
          such as violet and blue, are more easily absorbed by air molecules
          than light from longer wavelengths (that is, from red, orange, and
          yellow bands in the spectrum). Air molecules then radiate violet and
          blue light in different directions, saturating the sky. However, the
          midday sky appears blue, rather than a combination of blue and violet,
          because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet
          light.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the sun is near the horizon at dawn and dusk, the sun&#39;s rays
          strike the atmosphere at more-oblique (slanted) angles, and thus these
          rays must travel a greater distance through the atmosphere than they
          would at midday. As a result, there are more nitrogen and oxygen
          molecules and other particles that can block and scatter incoming
          sunlight. During this long passage, incoming radiation in the shorter
          blue and violet wavelengths is mostly filtered out, and the influence
          of these wavelengths over the color of the sky diminishes. What
          remains are the longer wavelengths, and some of these rays strike dust
          and other particles near the horizon, as well as the water droplets
          that make up clouds, to create the red, orange, and yellow tints we
          enjoy at sunrise and sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, after explaining it simply, let's discuss it from a scientific
          perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rayleigh&#39;s scattering has been the accepted explanation of why the
          sky appears blue during the day
          <a href="#1" class="refence">[1]</a>. The theory is that when midday
          sunlight traverses the troposphere, the air molecules scatter the
          shorter wavelength blue photons, while allowing the longer wavelength
          yellow and red photons to pass through to the ground. The same
          phenomenon that imparts blue color to the daytime sky has been used to
          explain how the sunrises and sunsets appear orange red. In a prior
          paper <a href="#2" class="refence">[2]</a>, we explained how instead
          of the above, the ozone layer in the stratosphere, might alone explain
          the blue color of the sky, the layers of dust in the lower troposphere
          partially “diluting” the blue of the ozone gas. We proposed that a
          primary way in which ozone contributes to the blue color may simply be
          by its existence in a defined layer, and the thickness of this layer
          making the pale blue gas appear deeper blue. Also, we wondered if some
          of the short wavelength blue photons are absorbed along with the
          ultraviolet and displayed by the ozone layer, which then accentuates
          the blue of the layer. We speculated that some of the ozone in the
          ozone layer might even be deeper blue due to becoming liquefied, in
          that area of the stratosphere with the markedly diminished gravity,
          especially in the sky at the poles. Thus, both the sky as it appears
          to observers on the surface of the earth, as well as the appearance of
          the earth from outer space, we proposed were due to the ozone. We also
          observed that the blue-black to black of the sky over the poles were
          likely due to the even lower temperatures prevailing at the poles,
          especially during winter months making the ozone gas actually becoming
          crystallized to blue-black solid. We suspect that it does so, even
          though the ambient temperature is not low enough for ozone to liquefy
          or crystallize on earth, but in the extremely rarefied state due to
          reduced gravity, in the tropopause where ozone layer is situated, such
          changes in the physical state of ozone may actually take place. This
          was offered as the true explanation, rather than a purported “hole”
          left by loss of ozone due to the use of chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol
          cans. We argued that any such depletion of ozone due to the aerosols
          would be over the landmasses where people live, especially over the
          industrialized countries and not in the poles where there are no human
          inhabitants. We had also offered some other phenomena to support the
          role of ozone in the color of the sky. Such were the presence of blue
          sky only on earth and Mars, the only planets with a layer or layers of
          ozone in their atmospheres. We also made the argument that after most
          of the dust and varying amounts of the atmosphere&#39;s constituent
          gases were removed by heavy rainfall, the intensification of the blue
          color of sky actually supports our notion that the color of the ozone
          layer is why the sky is blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The daytime sky on earth is a shade of blue of varying degrees, with
          the appearance of blue being the background color, and clouds floating
          against that background. The clouds take on different colors depending
          on the type of the cloud and the time of day, and they are constantly
          in motion against the prevailing background color of sky. In this
          paper, we ask the question, if the blue color of sky is due to
          scattering of short wavelength blue photons by atmospheric gases,
          shouldn&#39;t all objects in the atmosphere take on that color,
          including the clouds? Also, as 50% of the gases and particulates in
          the earth&#39;s atmosphere are held close to the surface of the earth
          by its gravity in the lower 5.6km of the troposphere, by Rayleigh
          scattering the deepest blue color should be close to the earth and
          make the horizon to appear deepest blue. In reality, the exact
          opposite is seen; the deepest blues are at the top (overhead) and the
          lightest or almost white parts of the sky are at the horizon. Dust
          held in the atmosphere closest to the surface of the earth obscuring
          the background color of the sky from ozone layer can explain this
          finding. There is unanimous agreement about the orange red of sunrises
          and sunsets as being due to sun&#39;s rays traversing parallel to the
          earth&#39;s surface, through layers of dust and in that process losing
          the short wavelength blue photons. We are in total agreement with this
          explanation; the appearance of the sky during the midday is a
          distinctly different phenomenon. When large amounts of dust and
          particulates are present in the lower atmosphere, the deep blue color
          of sky gets tempered by them and the blue gets lighter. It is
          interesting to note that the orange red of the sky at sunrises and
          sunsets are also imparted to the clouds, as the altered light from the
          rising and setting sun also fall upon them. We believe that by the
          same effect, daytime scattering of blues should affect the color of
          clouds, thus rendering them also blue. But that is not what we see.
          Also, heavy rainfalls at sunsets make both the sky and clouds much
          lighter yellow or almost white; evidently, the clearing of dust from
          the lower atmosphere is responsible for this effect. The exact same
          explanation can be put forward for the reddish appearance of moon just
          before the lunar eclipses; sunlight filtering through layers of air
          close to the earth&#39;s atmosphere accounts for the red color. It is
          not surprising that the background deep blue of the sky returns near
          the horizon after heavy rainfall at times other than at sunrises and
          sunsets. Similarly, the overhead sky becomes deeper blue, as the
          reduction of the dust in the lower layers of the troposphere removed
          the partial obscuring of the blue of the sky. In our previous paper
          (2), we made the observation that the only planets in our solar system
          with blue sky are the earth and Mars. These are also the only two
          planets with distinct layer(s) of ozone around them (7-10). In this
          paper, we provide data on the types and quantities of gases and
          elements in the respective atmospheres of the other planets. We are
          making the point and asking the question that, if Rayleigh scattering
          were responsible for the color of the earth&#39;s sky, why some of
          these planets also do not sport blue sky, as they also have
          substantial amounts of gases and elements in their respective
          atmospheres. Since Mars does have blue sky and it has two or more
          distinct layers of ozone, it is another argument that it is the ozone
          in the atmosphere in a well-defined layer(s) that leads to the blue
          color of the sky. For decades, the scientific community had been
          concerned about the effects of the propellants in aerosols
          (chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs) interacting with the ozone in the ozone
          layer and depleting it, which would then lead to many ill-effects from
          the unchecked flow of UV light on the earth&#39;s inhabitants (20-25).
          Two pieces of evidence have been offered by scientists for this
          concern: First, the observation of large dark areas in the poles,
          which have been called “Ozone holes”. Second, the demonstration of
          reduced amounts of ozone in those dark areas. In our paper we made the
          suggestion that, since these “holes” were found around the North and
          South poles, perhaps the appearance of blue/black in those cold
          locations was due to liquification or even crystallization of ozone,
          both of which lead to intense blue to black color to those areas. We
          also suggested that the “depletion” of ozone was perhaps because the
          existing methods of measuring ozone gas levels might not detect the
          physically altered ozone (liquid/solid). Then, during warmer months
          when more of the ozone returns to a gaseous form, the dark areas at
          the poles become smaller in size, and increased amounts of ozone are
          detected. We had also suggested that any reduction of ozone in the
          stratosphere due to degradation by CFCs, would be over the land masses
          of the industrialized countries, such as North America and Europe and
          not at the poles, where there are no human inhabitants. We maintain
          this explanation and offer the side-to-side comparison made by NASA
          (Fig. 3) of the appearance of the North pole during an exceptionally
          warm winter of 1984, with an extremely cold winter of 1997; this was
          interpreted by NASA as “abnormally warm, reducing ozone depletion, (in
          1984) and the appearance in 1997 as “abnormally cold, resulting in
          increased seasonal depletion” (of ozone). This explanation is
          interesting in two respects. First, how does intense cold of any
          winter lead to depletion of ozone? Second, if depletion of ozone in an
          area leads to the appearance of deep blue-black color in that area,
          does NASA not imply that the usual blue color of earth from outer
          space is due to ozone? And, by extension, the color of sky as viewed
          from the surface of the earth is also due to the color of ozone? An
          interesting, related phenomenon is the occasional appearance of a
          bluish tinge on moon just before lunar eclipse, in addition to the
          normal reddish hue; this has been interpreted as being due to the
          color of ozone in the stratosphere. Ozone is a pale blue gas on earth,
          but it becomes a deep blue liquid at around -112o C (-170o F) and a
          dark blue-black solid at an even colder temperature of -193o C (-315o
          F). The temperatures in that location does not descend to such levels,
          but the extremely rarefied air in that location (See Fig. 2) may
          impart unexpected effects on the process of
          condensation/crystallization. For example, when exposed to intense
          cold (as low as 2.7 Kelvin) and the extreme vacuum of deep space,
          water almost immediately takes on a globular shape, begins to boil
          first, before cooling and becoming ice, almost instantly after that.
          (30). This unusual effect on the behavior of water vapor in outer
          space is due to the combination of the ambient low temperature, as
          well as the markedly reduced air pressure prevailing there; this
          latter effect in turn is due to the markedly reduced gravitational
          pull from the earth. Whether this reduced gravity will have any other
          unknown effects on ozone is debatable. If in fact, the normal physical
          state of ozone in tropopause is as micro-droplets of liquid ozone all
          around the globe, rather than gaseous, our hypothesis becomes that
          much more likely. We can then state more confidently that around the
          North and South poles ozone in the tropopause becomes crystallized and
          then appears deep blue black in color.
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
          We hope that we have made credible arguments in this paper why the
          blue color of daytime sky is due to the color of ozone in the
          tropopause and not due to scattering of short-wave bluephotons by
          atmospheric air molecules. However, the sunsets and sunrises appear
          yellow-orange due to the sun&#39;s rays traversing the layers of dust
          close to the ground, and during that process the blue photons are
          lost, probably by absorption by the dust. Thus, this is closer to the
          Rayleigh scattering. The true color of the sky is probably a deep
          blue, as seen in pristine locations and as the earth appears from the
          space, and the gradations of the color of the sky result from the dust
          in our atmosphere, especially in urban locations. Finally, we propose
          that ozone exists in the ozone layer of the tropopause in
          micro-droplets of a deep blue liquid state, but in extremely cold
          locations, it transforms to a darker, blue/black microcrystalline
          state; the arctic and the Antarctic, and around the highest peaks of
          the Himalayas are such locations, and the sky may actually appear
          blue/black in those areas.
