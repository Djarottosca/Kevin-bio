          A quote from a novelist, Lawana Blackwell "Age is no guarantee of
          maturity" so maturity is in attitude and behaviour. Many people who
          are older but still behave childishly, are still immature.

          This article offers a philosophical examination of human maturity. The
          argument is that maturity in the human world has an infinite structure
          because it demands responsibility for the world. The world is a
          product of constitution: human beings produce the world, which is
          functionally a level of meaningfulness; but as each human being
          constitutes the world, each human being also enters the constituted
          world. Maturity thus demands responsibility not only for what is
          produced through one's agency but also what precedes one's agency. The
          structure of the conceived world is such that it can never be fully
          complete. Therefore, the responsibilities that exist in this world are
          unlimited rather than finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          This notion of maturity as infinite responsibility is examined through
          an enquiry into four questions. The first three questions pertain to
          maturity in the domains of human reason, action, and sciences. Mature
          reason is said to involve the development of critical responsibility.
          This implies the responsibility to expand the range of evidence
          evaluated and to expand the means of critical assessment of evidence,
          which requires efforts that go beyond rationality. Mature action, in
          turn, must take into account the ambiguity of actions and intentions,
          as these meanings in the human world are never fully formed. This
          requires a critical effort to distinguish needs and desires to
          establish intersubjectively meaningful criteria by which one can be
          held accountable. Human sciences, then, are called upon to examine
          human "needs" apart from the fundamental contingencies of human life.
          This requires mature human sciences to reject deterministic
          metaphysics in favour of a relational conception of human reality. The
          fourth and final question raised is how maturity can be chosen.
          Maturity is understood as the result of various human acts of
          judgement, so it is not the result of individual efforts towards
          personal maturity, but is produced through political agency to judge
          maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a psychological perspective, there are several characteristics of
          a mature person:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <b
            ><p>
              One of the characteristics is self-awareness and self-knowledge;
              Understanding the position and can place themselves according to
              their position.
            </p></b
          >
        </ol>
        <p>
          So what is maturity? Actually, maturity is a quality, or
          characteristic that consists of many things, such as, for example:
          Compassion, Kindness, Consideration, Balance or Inner Peace, Wisdom,
          Prudence, Perspective, Practicality, Honesty, perhaps a proper awe of
          existence, and what some call "Fortitude" - the ability to persevere
          in the face of adversity, the ability to endure hardship without
          constantly complaining or feeling victimised. A mature person is not
          quick to anger. Such a person is not careless with actions, thoughts,
          or feelings. Maturity rises to the level of appreciation and gratitude
          for all that is good and beautiful in life, while accepting that there
          are limitations and imperfections in the world. Mature people may want
          and work hard to change and improve things around them, but they will
          not wallow in aggravation, resentment, and frustration about things
          that need to be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of history, in most civilisations and societies, people
          regarded maturity as something to aspire to, hope for, and respect. In
          the past, people often tried to act more mature than their age would
          suggest. This still happens sometimes, but in very limited contexts,
          such as when someone is trying to get their first job. Immaturity, on
          the other hand, now seems to almost rule the culture. We see many
          people acting less mature than what is expected of their age.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ancient philosopher Diogenes was said to walk around everywhere
          during the daytime, carrying a lighted lamp, or lantern. Asked what he
          was doing, he liked to say, "Looking for an honest man". In our own
          time, he would have nearly as endless a trek looking for real
          maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immaturity is wrapped up in ego, a sense of entitlement, a lack of
          responsibility, and a tendency towards anger, as well as an
          inclination to delight in the flaws and sufferings of others. Immature
          people are prone to whining, resenting, and feeling slighted when
          others aren't suitably celebrating their specialness. Immature people
          throw fits and tantrums, regardless of age. They also tend to be as
          callous towards others as they are fragile in their own sense of need.
          And it makes you wonder how we ever got so far away from an
          appreciation of what it is to be truly mature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maturity is about proper growth and exemplary health. We should
          encourage it in others and seek to enhance it in our own lives.
