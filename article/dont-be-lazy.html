        <h1 id="text-header">Leonardo Da Vinci: Don't be lazy</h1>
        <p class="ps-2 justify-content-center"></p>
        <p>
          This is advice from Leonardo Da Vinci: your life needs activity, don't
          be lazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >I have long observed that successful people are rarely those who
            just sit and resign themselves to what happens to them. They go out
            and experience many things.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So, this is a principle against laziness. How do you avoid being lazy?
          Simply by not being lazy. There is no other way, just don't be lazy.
          If you feel lazy, then rise up and force yourself to get up. That's
          it, and get used to being active. Why does this happen? Because humans
          live according to their habits. If you are used to relaxing, hanging
          out, and not engaging in activities, that will become your habit. By
          getting used to being active, it is the only way out of your comfort
          zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be active. The key term from Leonardo Da Vinci is active. Leonardo
          himself stated that all successful people did not achieve success by
          sitting idly and resigning themselves. Whatever your aspirations are,
          they will not come true if you just sit and passively accept your
          circumstances. So, Leonardo's formula is to be active.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle of being active should not be imagined like 1 + 1 = 2.
          Being active means making an effort to move without worrying about the
          results. Sometimes, if we think too much about the results, we become
          pessimistic. "Oh no, no matter how hard I try, it seems impossible."
          This happens because you depend on your actions. You should depend
          only on God. We work, engage in activities, take action, and strive
          because it is our nature as humans. The results? That is up to God;
          you do not need to think about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not misidentify things; our duty as humans is to strive. Let me
          illustrate with the story of Prophet Ismail and his mother. When
          Prophet Ismail was a baby, he and his mother were left by Prophet
          Ibrahim in Mecca. Struggling to find water, his mother ran back and
          forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times. Eventually,
          water was found from where Prophet Ismail's foot struck the ground.
          Logically, one might ask why the water did not appear when he first
          struck the ground. This is a small part of God's secret; that's how it
          works. If you use mathematical logic, running around the hills of Safa
          and Marwah seven times results in finding water at Prophet Ismail's
          feet. But life is not like that; this is the analogy of effort and the
          outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, keep being active and strive without worrying too much
          about what you will achieve. If you focus solely on the target,
          sometimes the results can be disappointing. Ensure that what you do is
          good, beneficial, and productive. Thereafter, it is up to God and the
          universe to determine the appropriate outcome for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leonardo once said,
          <em
            >I have been impressed with the importance of action; knowing is not
            enough, we must execute.</em
          >
          This means that desire alone is not sufficient; we must take action.
          This statement emphasizes that we must dare to dream and hope, but
          dreams and hopes alone are not enough. If you only dream and hope
          without taking action, those dreams will not come true. To make dreams
          a reality, you have to wake up and act. Although everything starts
          with a dream, don't just keep dreaming. Don't think, "Life starts with
          a dream, so I want to sleep again." That's not how the universe works.
          If you keep sleeping with the excuse of wanting to dream, those dreams
          will never come true. To turn dreams into reality, you have to wake up
          and take action. Even though succeeding in a dream feels good, real
          success in reality is far more satisfying. If you only imagine or
          dream about being with someone without taking action, that pleasure
          will remain in your imagination. If you want to truly be happy, you
          must declare your love to the person you desire. The simple logic is
          this: don't just imagine. If someone else gets ahead of you, you will
          end up crying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Leonardo Da Vinci's analogy:
          <em
            >Iron rusts from disuse, stagnant water loses its clarity, and cold
            water freezes</em
          >. Similarly, inactivity weakens the mind. Therefore, we must stretch
          ourselves to the limits of our potential; if we fall short of this, we
          sin. We sin against God and against humanity." What does this mean?
          Realize your potential, use the facilities and strength given by God
          to their fullest extent. If we don't use them 100%, we are sinning.
          Why is this so? Because God has given us these gifts, and it is a
          waste if we do not use them. God has given you eyes, intellect, ears,
          energy, and strength; all these are facilities from God. Use them to
          the fullest for good, for realizing the ideals of truth and beauty you
          hold. If there are things you don't use or you hesitate to use,
          according to Leonardo, you are committing a sin.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>First, a sin against God for wasting His blessings.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Second, a sin against other humans because you should be able to
              bring great benefits to your surroundings, but this doesn't happen
              because you are lazy.
