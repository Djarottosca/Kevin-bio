        <h1 id="text-header">What's Density Functional Theory?</h1>
        <p class="ps-2 justify-content-center"></p>
        <p>
          There are many fields within the physical sciences and engineering
          where the key to scientific and technological progress is
          understanding and controlling the properties of matter at the level of
          individual atoms and molecules. Density functional theory is a
          phenomenally successful approach to finding solutions to the
          fundamental equation that describes the quantum behavior of atoms and
          molecules, the Sch&ouml;rdinger equation, in settings of practical
          value. This approach has rapidly grown from being a specialized art
          practiced by a small number of physicists and chemists at the cutting
          edge of quantum mechanical theory to a tool that is used regularly by
          large numbers of researchers in chemistry, physics, materials science,
          chemical engineering, geology, and other disciplines. A search of the
          Science Citation Index for articles published in 1986 with the words
          “density functional theory” in the title or abstract yields less than
          50 entries. Repeating this search for 1996 and 2006 gives more than
          1100 and 5600 entries, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of this book is to provide just what the title says: an
          introduction to using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in
          a practical context. It is designed under the premise that the reader
          may lack prior experience or a comprehensive understanding of these
          calculations. Instead, it assumes a reader who harbors an interest in
          exploring the potential applications of such methods. Whether the aim
          is to independently conduct calculations in a research setting or to
          engage proficiently with collaborators employing these methods, this
          book endeavors to impart the requisite knowledge and skills.

          An analogy related to cars may be useful here. Before you learned how
          to drive, it was presumably clear to you that you can accomplish many
          useful things with the aid of a car. For you to use a car, it is
          important to understand the basic concepts that control cars (you need
          to put fuel in the car regularly, you need to follow basic traffic
          laws, etc.) and spend time actually driving a car in a variety of road
          conditions. You do not, however, need to know every detail of how fuel
          injectors work, how to construct a radiator system that efficiently
          cools an engine, or any of the other myriad of details that are
          required if you were going to actually build a car. Many of these
          details may be important if you plan on undertaking some especially
          difficult car-related project such as, say, driving yourself across
          Antarctica, but you can make it across town to a friend’s house and
          back without understanding them.

          With this book, I was able to learn to "drive across town" when
          performing calculations with the DFT package or when interpreting
          others' calculations dealing with physical questions of interest to
          me. I am interested in “building a better car” by advancing the
          cutting edge of method development in this area.
