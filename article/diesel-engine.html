            <p class="ps-2 justify-content-center"></p>
             <p>In general, engines convert thermal energy into mechanical motion and these are called heat engines. 
              Heat engines are generally classified into External Combustion engines (EC engines) and Internal Combustion engines (IC engines). 
              External combustion engines are engines whose combustion is located on the outside, as examples of this type of engine are steam 
              engines and steam turbines. In steam engines and steam turbines, the heat from fuel combustion will produce high-pressure steam,
               where the steam will operate the turbine or engine.</p>
             <p>External combustion engines are a type of combustion motor in which the combustion process occurs outside of 
              the construction or mechanism of the engine. This combustion is carried out to produce changes in heat energy 
              which is then transmitted through the connecting media from the combustion chamber to the engine construction. 
              Examples of this type of engine are steam engines&#47steam turbines and nuclear engines&#47nuclear turbines.</p>
             <p>Internal combustion engines are a motor engine whose combustion process in producing heat energy changes 
              occur within the engine construction itself. This is what distinguishes this internal combustion from external 
              combustion, namely the absence of certain connecting channels because the entire combustion process occurs inside 
              the engine components, more precisely in the combustion chamber. This internal combustion 
              engine can be found in petrol motors, diesel motors and jet engines.</p>
             <p>Internal combustion engines convert the chemical energy in the fuel into mechanical energy. 
              The diesel engine that has served mankind for over a century is the most versatile and economical internal combustion engine. 
              In order to effectively release the chemical energy in diesel the atomised fuel is made to come into contact with high 
              temperature and high pressure air. This energy is effectively transferred as mechanical rotational energy so the operation of 
              a diesel engine is to generate high temperature high pressure air continuously.</p>
             <p>In diesel engines the combustion chamber can consist of one or more depending on its use and in one cylinder can consist 
              of one or two torques. In general, in one diesel motor cylinder only has one piston. Gas pressure from the combustion of fuel 
              and air will push the piston which is connected to the crankshaft using a piston rod, so that the piston can move back and
              forth (reciprocating). The reciprocating motion of the piston will be converted into rotational motion by the crank shaft.
              And vice versa, the rotational motion of the crankshaft is also converted into reciprocating motion of the piston in the compression step. 
              Based on how to analyse the working system, diesel motors can be divided into two, namely diesel motors that use airless injection systems 
              (solid injection) which are analysed with dual cycles and diesel motors that use air injection systems which are analysed with diesel cycles
              (while gasoline motors are analysed with otto cycles). </p>
             <p>In a diesel engine, a &quotchamber&quot is created so that 
              the chamber will increase in temperature until it reaches a &quotflash point&quot capable of "burning" the fuel oil. The compression used 
              to reach the &quotburning&quot state is usually 18 to 25 times the normal chamber volume. 
                When air is compressed its temperature will increase (as stated by Charles&#39 Law), diesel engines use 
                this property for the combustion process. Air is sucked into the combustion chamber of a diesel engine and compressed
                 by the docked piston, much higher than the compression ratio of a petrol engine. Moments before the piston is at 
                 the Top Dead Centre (TDC) position, diesel fuel is injected into the combustion chamber at high pressure through a nozzle
                  to mix with the high-pressure hot air. The result of this mixing ignites and burns quickly. Spraying fuel into the combustion 
                  chamber starts when the piston is approaching (very near) TDC to avoid detonation. </p>
             <p>This closed explosion causes the gas in the combustion chamber to expand rapidly, pushing the piston downwards and producing linear power.
               The connecting rod channels this movement to the crankshaft and the crankshaft converts the linear power into rotary power. The rotating power
                at the end of the crankshaft is utilised for various purposes. </p>
                <p>To upgrade the performance of a diesel engine, components are generally added: 
                  <li><p>Turbocharger or supercharger to increase the volume of air entering the combustion chamber because the air entering 
                    the combustion chamber is driven by the turbine on the turbo/supercharger.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Intercooler to cool the air that will enter the combustion chamber. Hot air will expand in volume and vice versa, 
                    so it is cooled so that the air that occupies the combustion chamber can be more.</p></li>
                </p>
             <p>Diesel engines are difficult to start when the engine is cold. 
              Some engines use a small electronic heater called a spark/glow plug in the cylinder to heat the combustion chamber before engine ignition. 
              Others use a "resistive grid" heater in the intake manifold to warm the intake air until the engine reaches operating temperature. 
              Once the engine is operating the combustion of fuel in the cylinder effectively heats the engine. </p>
             <p>Modifications made can be in the form of reducing the weight on the fly wheel which results in an increase in motor rotation, 
              reducing the height of the cylinder head which aims to increase the compression ratio in the combustion chamber which will also increase the engine output power. 
              In addition to these two types of modifications there is a relatively easy modification method to do, namely making changes in the intake manifold on a diesel engine. 
              The changes that can be made to this intake manifold are the provision of threads on the inner surface of the intake manifold with threaded wavelengths. 
              The treatment of changes in the form of screwing on the inner surface of the intake manifold is expected to produce a more perfect combustion process 
              that occurs in the cylinder&#47;combustion chamber of a diesel engine. This will be seen from the effect of giving threads on the inner surface of the 
              intake manifold which causes the air flow entering the cylinder to be turbulent (Swirl Flow).</p>
             <p>Recently, there has been research on changing the shape of the diesel engine intake manifold which has proven to be able to improve engine performance. 
              However, the changes made are limited to increasing the diameter of the inlet side which will also increase the inlet angle of the intake manifold itself. 
              Based on previous research, further research was conducted by adding threads to the inner surface of the diesel engine intake manifold. 
              The regulation of air supply into the combustion chamber is one of the important aspects that can greatly affect exhaust emissions, fuel efficiency and engine performance. 
              Regulating the air required for combustion is the process used to ensure that the correct air is supplied into the combustion chamber under all engine operating conditions. 
              In engines, the configuration of the intake system plays an important role in determining whether or not an engine performs well. The intake manifold is one of 
              the most important components in diesel engines because the intake manifold is the air intake channel. Air is needed during combustion in the combustion chamber so that 
              the intake manifold plays an important role for free air intake from the environment. In the intake manifold there are various constituent components, one of which is the intrunner 
              valve which is the inner air intake hole before the air enters the combustion chamber.</p>
