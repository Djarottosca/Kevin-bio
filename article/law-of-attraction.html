        <p class="ps-2 justify-content-center"></p>
        <p>
          The Universe is governed by Law—one great Law. Its manifestations are
          multiform, but viewed from the Ultimate there is but one Law. We are
          familiar with some of its manifestations, but are almost totally
          ignorant of certain others. Still we are learning a little more every
          day—the veil is being gradually lifted. We speak learnedly of the Law
          of Gravitation, but ignore that equally wonderful manifestation, The
          Law of Attraction in the Thought World. We are familiar with that
          wonderful manifestation of Law which draws and holds together the
          atoms of which matter is composed—we recognize the power of the law
          that attracts bodies to the earth, that holds the circling worlds in
          their places, but we close our eyes to the mighty law that draws to us
          the things we desire or fear, that makes or mars our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we come to see that Thought is a force—a manifestation of
          energy—having a magnet-like power of attraction, we will begin to
          understand the why and wherefore of many things that have heretofore
          seemed dark to us. There is no study that will so well repay the
          student for his time and trouble as the study of the workings of this
          mighty law of the world of Thought— the Law of Attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we think we send out vibrations of a fine ethereal substance,
          which are as real as the vibrations manifesting light, heat,
          electricity, magnetism. That these vibrations are not evident to our
          five senses is no proof that they do not exist. A powerful magnet will
          send out vibrations and exert a force sufficient to attract to itself
          a piece of steel weighing a hundred pounds, but we can neither see,
          taste, smell, hear nor feel the mighty force. These thought
          vibrations, likewise, cannot be seen, tasted, smelled, heard nor felt
          in the ordinary way; although it is true there are on record cases of
          persons peculiarly sensitive to psychic impressions who have perceived
          powerful thought-waves, and very many of us can testify that we have
          distinctly felt the thought vibrations of others, both whilst in the
          presence of the sender and at a distance. Telepathy and its kindred
          phenomena are not idle dreams.
        </p>
        <h4>It begs the question: Is the law of attraction real?</h4>
        <p>
          The law of attraction is a philosophy suggesting that positive
          thoughts bring positive results into a person's life, while negative
          thoughts bring negative outcomes. In other words, a positive mindset
          will attract more success and happiness than a negative one. And this
          "law" applies to all areas of life including health, finances, and
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Law of Attraction, like the Law of Gravity, is always working –
          even if you don’t think about it or believe in it. Law of Attraction
          is based on the theorem that we attract more of the things that
          capture our attention. However, if we sustain that attention for a
          period of time and add strong emotion, it speeds the process up
          exponentially.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here’s the problem: Law of Attraction (LoA) works on the things
          that we want as well as the things that we don’t want. Just like the
          Law of Gravity doesn’t care if you are dropping a ball or a china cup
          (both will fall – guaranteed), LoA doesn’t care if you want the thing
          you are manifesting or not. Therefore, if you are chasing your tail
          with money worries and lack mentality, you are ensuring that you will
          be receiving more lack and money worries. If only we could have proof
          that it works.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How does the law of attraction work?</b> Essentially, the energy of
          your thoughts manifest your experiences. So positive thoughts manifest
          positive experiences and vice versa. Advocates suggest there are
          central universal principles that make up the law of attraction:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Like attracts like: This law suggests that similar things are
              attracted to one another. It means that people tend to attract
              people who are similar to them—but it also suggests that people's
              thoughts tend to attract similar results. Negative thinking is
              believed to attract negative experiences, while positive thinking
              is believed to produce desirable experiences. Nature abhors a
              vacuum: This law of attraction suggests that removing negative
              things from your life can make space for more positive things to
              take their place. It is based on the notion that it is impossible
              to have a completely empty space in your mind and in your life.
              Since something will always fill this space, it is important to
              fill that space with positivity, proponents of this philosophy
              say.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The present is always perfect: This law focuses on the idea that
              there are always things you can do to improve the present moment.
              While it might always seem like the present is somehow flawed,
              this law proposes that, rather than feeling dread or unhappiness,
              you should focus your energy on finding ways to make the present
              moment the best that it can be.
