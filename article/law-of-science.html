        <p>
          Legend has it that a young Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple
          tree when he was bonked on the head by a falling piece of fruit, a
          17th-century “aha moment” that prompted him to suddenly come up with
          his law of gravity. In reality, things didn’t go down quite like that.
          Newton, the son of a farmer, was born in 1642 near Grantham, England,
          and entered Cambridge University in 1661. Four years later, following
          an outbreak of the bubonic plague, the school temporarily closed,
          forcing Newton to move back to his childhood home, Woolsthorpe Manor.
          It was during this period at Woolsthorpe (Newton returned to Cambridge
          in 1667) that he was in the orchard there and witnessed an apple drop
          from a tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve all heard the story. A young Isaac Newton is sitting beneath an
          apple tree contemplating the mysterious universe. Suddenly – boink!
          -an apple hits him on the head. “Aha!” he shouts, or perhaps,
          “Eureka!” In a flash he understands that the very same force that
          brought the apple crashing toward the ground also keeps the moon
          falling toward the Earth and the Earth falling toward the sun:
          gravity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or something like that. The apocryphal story is one of the most famous
          in the history of science and now you can see for yourself what Newton
          actually said. Squirreled away in the archives of London’s Royal
          Society was a manuscript containing the truth about the apple.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the manuscript for what would become a biography of Newton
          entitled Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Lifewritten by William
          Stukeley, an archaeologist and one of Newton’s first biographers, and
          published in 1752. Newton told the apple story to Stukeley, who
          relayed it as such:
        </p>
        <p>
          “After dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden and
          drank thea, under the shade of some apple trees…he told me, he was
          just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of
          gravitation came into his mind. It was occasion’d by the fall of an
          apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always
          descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself…”
        </p>
        <p>
          So it turns out the apple story is true – for the most part. The apple
          may not have hit Newton in the head, but I’ll still picture it that
          way. Meanwhile, three and a half centuries and an Albert Einstein
          later, physicists still don’t really understand gravity. We’re gonna
          need a bigger apple.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no evidence to suggest the fruit actually landed on his head,
          but Newton’s observation caused him to ponder why apples always fall
          straight to the ground (rather than sideways or upward) and helped
          inspired him to eventually develop his law of universal gravitation.
          In 1687, Newton first published this principle, which states that
          every body in the universe is attracted to every other body with a
          force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and
          inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, in
          his landmark work the “Principia,” which also features his three laws
          of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1726, Newton shared the apple anecdote with William Stukeley, who
          included it in a biography, “Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Life,”
          published in 1752. According to Stukeley, “After dinner, the weather
          being warm, we went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of
          some apple trees… he told me, he was just in the same situation, as
          when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind….
          occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative
          mood.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The esteemed mathematician and physicist died in 1727 and was buried
          at Westminster Abbey. His famous apple tree continues to grow at
          Woolsthorpe Manor.
        </p>
        <h4>Isaac Newton: More than Master of Gravity</h4>
        <p>
          Decoding gravity was only part of Newton's contribution to mathematics
          and science. His other major mathematical preoccupation was calculus,
          and along with German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, Newton
          developed differentiation and integration—techniques that remain
          fundamental to mathematicians and scientists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, his interest in optics led him to propose, correctly, that
          white light is actually the combination of light of all the colors of
          the rainbow. This, in turn, made plain the cause of chromatic
          aberration—inaccurate color reproduction—in the telescopes of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve the problem, Newton designed a telescope that used mirrors
          rather than just glass lenses, which allowed the new apparatus to
          focus all the colors on a single point—resulting in a crisper, more
          accurate image. To this day, reflecting telescopes, including the
          Hubble Space Telescope, are mainstays of astronomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following his apple insight, Newton developed the three laws of
          motion, which are, in his own words:
        </p>
        <p>
          Newton's Law of Inertia: Every object persists in its state of rest or
          uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change
          that state by forces impressed upon it. Newton's Law of Acceleration:
          Force is equal to the change in momentum (mV) per change in time. For
          a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration [expressed in
          the famous equation F = ma]. Newton's Law of Action and Reaction: For
          every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Newton published his findings in 1687 in a book called Philosophiae
          Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural
          Philosophy) commonly known as the Principia.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Newton's Principia made him famous—few people read it, and even fewer
          understood it, but everyone knew that it was a great work, rather like
          Einstein's Theory of Relativity over two hundred years later," writes
          mathematician Robert Wilson of the Open University in an article on a
          university website.
