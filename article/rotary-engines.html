          The majority of both diesel and gasoline engines use a 4-stroke cycle
          of suction, compression, stroke, and exhaust. A rotary engine does the
          same four tasks, but each happens in a different part of the housing.
          It's like having a dedicated cylinder for each of the four jobs, with
          a piston that moves continuously from one to the next.

          Rotary engines (originally designed and developed by Dr. Felix Wankel)
          are sometimes called Wankel engines, or Wankel rotary engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, we will learn how a rotary engine works. Let's start
          with the basic workings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rotary engines, or Wankel engines, work on the basic principle of
          spinning rotation to generate power. Here is how a typical Wankel
          engine works:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
          <p>
            <li>
              Working Chamber: A Wankel engine consists of a triangular working
              chamber bounded by the rotor, housing, and apex seals. The rotor
              is the main component that rotates inside the engine housing.
            </li>
          </p>
          <li>
            Working Cycle: The Wankel engine goes through four stages in the
            working cycle: suction, compression, combustion, and exhaust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suction: In this stage, the rotor rotates so that the volume of the
            working chamber enlarges and air mixed with fuel is sucked into the
            working chamber.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compression: After suction, the rotor rotates again, shrinking the
            volume of the working chamber and effectively compressing the
            air-fuel mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combustion: When the air-fuel mixture is compressed, the spark plug
            ignites and causes rapid combustion of the mixture. The pressure
            generated by combustion pushes the rotor in the direction of
            rotation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exhaust: After combustion, the rotor continues to rotate, pushing
            the exhaust gases out of the working chamber through the exhaust
            ducts.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This process continues to repeat continuously with the rotation of the
          rotor, producing continuous power.
