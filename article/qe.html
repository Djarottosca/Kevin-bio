          <code>Quantum ESPRESSO</code> is a suite for first-principles
          electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, distributed
          for free and as free software under the GNU General Public License. It
          is based on density-functional theory, plane wave basis sets, and
          pseudopotentials (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft). ESPRESSO is an
          acronym for opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure,
          Simulation, and Optimization.

          The core plane wave DFT functions of QE are provided by the PWscf
          component (PWscf previously existed as an independent project). PWscf
          (Plane-Wave Self-Consistent Field) is a set of programs for electronic
          structure calculations within density functional theory and density
          functional perturbation theory, using plane wave basis sets and
          pseudopotentials. The software is released under the GNU General
          Public License. It is designed to be used in the field of condensed
          matter physics, and it is able to perform simulations of systems made
          up of thousands of atoms.

          Quantum Espresso is a software suite for electronic structure
          calculations and materials modeling, used in the field of
          computational materials science. It is a highly advanced tool, capable
          of performing various types of calculations, including density
          functional theory (DFT) simulations, molecular dynamics, and
          self-consistent field (SCF) calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning Quantum Espresso can be a challenging task, as it requires a
          strong background in materials science, quantum mechanics, and
          computational methods. Becoming proficient in its use may require a
          significant investment of time and effort, and is likely not feasible
          to accomplish in a short time frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, having a background in this field, I was able to start using
          Quantum Espresso relatively quickly, as the software provides a wide
          range of resources and tutorials, including user manuals, online
          forums, and example input files. These resources can be used to
          quickly get up to speed with the basic functionality of the software,
          although it will still take time and practice to become an expert
          user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning and using Quantum Espresso can require a significant
          investment in time and effort. It is a complex software package that
          requires a strong background in physics, materials science, and
          computer science. Understanding the underlying theory and mathematical
          concepts is necessary for effectively using Quantum Espresso.
          Additionally, the software has a steep learning curve and requires a
          lot of computational resources.
