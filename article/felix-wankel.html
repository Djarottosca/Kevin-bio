          Felix Wankel, (born August 13, 1902, Lahr, Germany-died October 9,
          1988, Lindau, Germany), German engineer and inventor of the Wankel
          rotary engine. Wankel reportedly invented the basic idea for a new
          type of internal combustion gasoline engine when he was only 17 years
          old. In 1924, Wankel established a small laboratory where he began the
          research and development of his dream engine, which would be able to
          achieve intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust, all while
          rotating. He carried his knowledge of rotary valves into his work at
          the German Aeronautical Research Establishment during World War II,
          and at the leading German motorcycle company, NSU Motorenwerk AG,
          beginning in 1951. Wankel completed the design of his first rotary
          piston engine in 1954, and the first unit was tested in 1957.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wankel never earned an engineering degree or obtained a driver's
          license. As the son of a forestry official in the Black Forest region
          of southern Germany, he grew up in difficult circumstances after his
          father was killed in World War I. As a young man, he was convinced
          that he could do it. As a young man, convinced that he could design a
          practical rotary engine (the concept was well known but usually
          considered unworkable), he set up a small engineering business in
          Heidelberg while supporting himself with other jobs such as selling
          books. He was briefly a member of the Nazi Party before it came to
          power. During the Nazi period and World War II, he lived in Lindau, on
          Lake Constance (near the border with Switzerland), where he worked on
          designs for seals, unconventional rotary valves, and rotary engines
          for automobile and aircraft engines. At various times, he worked for
          the automobile companies Daimler-Benz and BMW as well as the German
          air force.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the war, Wankel's workshop was dismantled by the Allied
          authorities, and in 1951 he began working in Lindau with the research
          department of the engine manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerk AG. He
          completed the first design of a rotary engine for NSU in 1954, and
          prototype units were tested in 1957 and 1958. In 1961, Mazda, a
          Japanese automobile company, contracted NSU to manufacture and develop
          Wankel engines in Japan. Rotary-engined Mazda cars were introduced to
          the Japanese market in the 1960s and to the American market in 1971.
          Wankel established a series of his own research sites in Lindau, where
          he continued to work under contract for various companies on the
          fundamental problems and future applications of rotary engines.

          The Wankel engine has a very different structure to conventional
          reciprocating piston engines. Instead of having a piston that moves up
          and down inside a cylinder, the Wankel engine has an orbiting,
          triangular-shaped rotor that rotates inside an enclosed chamber. Each
          quarter turn of the rotor completes the expansion or compression of
          the gas in the chamber, so the four functions that characterize all
          internal combustion engines, intake, compression, expansion, and
          exhaust, can be performed in a single turn of the rotor. The only
          moving parts are the rotor and the output shaft. In theory, the
          advantages of this design include its light weight, few moving parts,
          compactness, low initial cost, fewer repairs required, and relatively
          smooth performance.
