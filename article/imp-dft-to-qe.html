          <strong><em>Density Functional Theory</em></strong> (DFT), the entire
          field of density functional theory rests on two fundamental
          mathematical theorem proved by Kohn and Hohenberg and the derivation
          of a set of equation by Kohn and Sham in the mid-1960s.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The first theorem</strong>, proven by Hohenberg and Kohn,
          states:
          <em
            >The ground-state energy of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation is a
            unique function of the electron density.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          This theorem establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the
          ground-state wave function and the electron density of the ground
          state. To understand this, first, we must know what such a "function"
          is. A function takes values from a variable and defines a single value
          of that variable. A simple example of a function dependent on a single
          variable is
          <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

          . Functionals require another function and define a single value of a
          function, for example,

          It is a functional of the function <i>f(x)</i>. If we calculate this
          function using <span>x<sup>3</sup> + 1</span>, we get
          <span>F[f] = 2</span>. So, we can redefine the result by expressing
          the energy of the ground state <i>E</i> as
          <span>E[n(<b>r</b>)]</span>, where <span>n(<b>r</b>)</span> is the
          electron density.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another way to explain the results of Hohenberg and Kohn's is that the
          electron density in the ground state can uniquely explain all
          characteristics, including energy and wave function, of the ground
          state. This result is important because we can think of solving the
          Schr&ouml;dinger equation by seeking a function using three spatial
          variables. electron density, rather than a function of 3N variables of
          wave functions. However, from the explanation of this theorem, it
          cannot yet explain the wave function. To explain the wave function
          using the theorem mentioned by Hohenberg-Kohn.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> The second theorem</strong> defines an important property of
          the functional:
          <em
            >The electron density that minimizes the energy of the overall
            functional is the true electron density corresponding to the full
            solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation</em
          >. If the ”true” functional form were known, the electron density
          could be varied until the energy from the functional is minimized,
          giving a prescription for finding the relevant electron density. This
          variational principle is used in practice with approximate forms of
          the functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          A useful way to write down the functional described by the Hohenberg-
          Kohn theorem is in term of the single-electron wave function,
          &psi;<sub>i</sub>(<i>r</i>). The energy functional can be write as
        </p>
        <center>
          <p>
            E[&psi;<sub>i</sub>] = E<sub>known</sub>[&psi;<sub>i</sub>] +
            E<sub>XC</sub>[&psi;<sub>i</sub>]
          </p>
        </center>

        <p>
          Where we have split the functional into a collection of terms we can
          write down in a simple analytical form,
          <em>E<sub>known</sub>[&psi;<sub>i</sub>]</em>, and everything else,
          <em>E<sub>XC</sub></em
          >. The "known" term includes four contributions:
        </p>
        <center>
          <p>
            <span>
              \( E_{\text{known}}[\psi_{i}] = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \sum_{i} \int
              \psi_{i}^{\star}\nabla^2\psi_{i} \, d^3r + \int
              V(\mathbf{r})n(\mathbf{r}) \, d^3r <br />
              + \iint \frac{n(\mathbf{r})n(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})}{|\mathbf{r} -
              \mathbf{r}^{\prime}|} \, d^3r \, d^3r^{\prime} + E_{\text{ion}} \)
            </span>
          </p>
        </center>
        <p>
          The terms on the right are, in order, the electron kinetic energies,
          the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the nuclei, the
          Coulomb interactions between pairs of the electrons, and the Coulomb
          interaction between pairs of nuclei. The other term in the complete
          energy functional, E<sub>XC</sub>[&psi;<sub>i</sub>], is the
          exchange-correlation functional, and it is defined to include all the
          quantum mechanical effects that are not included in the ”known” terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          \[ \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) +
          V_{H}(\mathbf{r})+ V_{XC}(\mathbf{r})\right]\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r}) =
          \varepsilon_{i}\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r}) \]
        </p>
        <p>
          These equations are superficially similar to Equation. The main
          difference is that the Kohn-Sham equations are missing the summations
          that appear inside the full Schr&ouml;dinger equation (Equation). This
          is because the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations are single-electron
          wave function that depend on only three spatial variables,
          \(\psi_i(\mathbf{r})\). On the left-hand side of the Kohn-Sham
          equations there are three potentials, V, V<span><sub>H</sub></span>
          dan V<span><sub>XC</sub></span
          >. The first of these alse appeared in the full Schr&ouml;dinger
          equation and in the ”known” part of the total energy functional given
          in Equation. This potential defines the interaction between an
          electron and the collection of atomic nuclei. The second is called the
          Hartree potential and is defined by
        </p>
        <center>
          <p>
            <span>
              \( V_{H}(\mathbf{r}) = e^{2} \int
              \frac{n(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})}{|\mathbf{r} \mathbf{r}^{\prime}|}
              d^{3} \mathbf{r}^{\prime} \)
            </span>
          </p>
        </center>
        <p>
          This potential describes the Coulomb repulsion between the electron
          being considered in one of the Kohn-Sham equations and the total
          electron density defined by all electrons in the problem. The Hartree
          potential includes a so-called self-interaction contribution because
          the electron is also part of the total electron density, so part of
          V<span><sub>H</sub></span> involves a Coulomb interaction between the
          electron and itself. The self-interaction is unphysical, and the
          correction for it is one of several effects that are lumped together
          into the final potential in the Kohn-Sham equations, V<span
            ><sub>XC</sub></span
          >, which defines exchange and correlation contributions to the
          single-electron equations. V<span><sub>XC</sub></span> can formally be
          defined as a ”functional derivative” of the exchange-correlation
          energy:
        </p>
        <center>
          <p>
            <span>
              \( V_{XC}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\delta E_{XC}}{\delta
              \rho(\mathbf{r})} \)
            </span>
          </p>
        </center>

        <p>
          The functional derivative is written using &delta; rather than d to
          emphasize that it's not quite identical to a normal derivative.

          <strong> The phenomena in this study</strong> are processed using a
          programme that has implemented the DFT method. Quantum ESPRESSO
          (opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation,
          and Optimisation) is a program (software) that specifically calculates
          periodic systems. In my thesis, I calculated using DFT with Quantum
          ESPRESSO software. DFT calculation using Quantum ESPRESSO requires a
          basis set (BC) and exchange correlation (XC). The basis set and
          exchange correlation used are Plane-Wave (PW) and pseudopotential (PP)
          respectively with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The implementation of DFT</strong> in
          <code>Quantum ESPRESSO</code> has been extensively utilized in the
          field of computation. The implementation entails the following:

        <p>
          <strong> The ground state calculations </strong> performed by
          <code>Quantum ESPRESSO</code> encompass total energy, forces,
          stresses, and Kohn-Sham orbitals. Structural optimization, molecular
          dynamics, and potential energy studies involve investigating the
          dynamics of molecules. One of these is the Born-Oppenheimer molecular
          dynamics (PWscf package). In Quantum ESPRESSO, the package utilized
          for computations in this final project is the
          <em>Plane-Wave Self-Consistent Field</em> (PWscf) with the command
          <code>pw.x</code>. The <code>pw.x</code> command requires additional
          information, namely <em>pseudopotentials</em> (PP) for each type of
          atom in the calculation. <em>The pseudopotentials used</em> in this
