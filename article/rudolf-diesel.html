          The story of the man behind the diesel engine. French-German engineer 
          Rudolf Diesel started out by designing refrigerators. Rudolf Diesel was 
          born in Paris, France, on March 18, 1858. His parents were immigrants. When 
          the Franco-Prussian War broke out, the family was deported to England in 1870.
          From there, Diesel went to Germany to study at the Polytechnic Institute where he 
          showed exceptional talent in engineering. After graduating, starting in 1880, he 
          worked as a refrigeration engineer in Paris at the Lindy Ice Machine Company, 
          where he learned a lot about thermodynamics under the guidance of Carl von Linde. </p>
         <p>
          In 1890 he took a job as head of the engineering department at the same
          refrigeration company located in Berlin and during his spare time he
          experimented with his engine designs he was assisted in the development
          of his designs by the Asburg machine factory now known as the Diesel and
          Freed band which is now Tyson Craft Rudolf Diesel designed many heat
          engines including solar air engines. </p>
          <p>
          In 1892, he patented the revolutionary compression ignition known as the
          diesel engine. Unlike steam engines or early petrol engines, it worked
          by compressing the air inside the cylinder, making it hot enough to
          ignite the fuel and create a powerful explosion. It was a very simple
          and economical system. It was created to run on a variety of fuels
          including coal dust and vegetable oil.</p>
          <p>
          1892 he obtained a patent forthe development of his diesel engine. </p>
          <p>
          1893 he published a paper describing an engine with combustion inside the cylinder called the
          internal combustion engine. On 10 August 1893 Rudolf diesel&#39s first
          model, a 10-foot iron cylinder with a flywheel at the bottom, ran under
          its own power. For the first time he received a patent for the engine in
          the same year and also a patent for an improvement diesel spent 2 more
          years making improvements and in 1896 he exhibited another model with a
          theoretical efficiency of 75&#37 in contrast to the 10&#37 efficiency of a
          steam engine or an early internal combustion engine work continued to
          develop a production model. </p>
          <p>
          In 1898 Rudolf diesel was granted a patent
          for the internal combustion engine Rudolf diesel's inventions had three
          things in common namely they were concerned with the transfer of heat
          through natural physical processes or natural laws involving highly
          creative mechanical designs and were initially motivated by the
          inventor's concept of social needs i.e. small entrepreneurs could
          compete with large industries but the latter goal did not go as expected
          his inventions were not only used by small businesses but industrialists
          who enthusiastically adopted them should also immediately skyrocket with
          various applications that drove the rapid development of the industrial
          revolution.</p>
          <p>
          One of his early devices was demonstrated at the 1900
          world's fair in Paris. It ran on peanut oil and won the Grand Prix. The
          invention was more environmentally friendly and power efficient than the
          alternatives at the time. And farmers could actually grow their own
          fuel. Diesel became an evangelist for the use of vegetable oils as fuel. </p>
          <p>Rudolf was looking for a way to help small businesses compete with big,
          cash-strapped industries. His idea started by utilising the application
          of the laws of thermodynamics. Creating more efficient machines to help
          small people like farmers, craftsmen and entrepreneurs.</p> 
          <p>Rudolf diesel was a visionary with a burning passion for realising dreams and creating
          an irreplaceable legacy for the world, his diesel engine not only
          symbolises technological innovation but also reflects the determination
          and dedication of a true Pioneer.</p>
