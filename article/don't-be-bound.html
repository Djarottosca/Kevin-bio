          Leonardo Da Vinci: <em>Do not be bound by anything</em>
        </h1>
        <p class="ps-2 justify-content-center"></p>
        <p>
          <em>He Who possesses most must be most afraid of loss.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have much, your fear of losing it will be greater. This advice
          serves as a reminder that we should not base our lives on possessions.
          If your life depends on possessions, it will be filled with the fear
          of loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          We often connect ourselves to things outside of ourselves using words
          like "have" or "own." The same applies to wealth, "I now have a
          MacBook, this MacBook is mine." Eventually, there will come a time
          when you face the loss of your MacBook, whether it is stolen or
          broken. When your MacBook breaks, you will feel extraordinary sadness
          because you had previously declared that the MacBook was yours.
          Religion often advises us, reminding us not to depend on anyone but
          God, as dependency on anything else will lead to fear and eventually
          disappointment. Everything besides God will inevitably leave us,
          regardless of what it is. Therefore, if you want to live peacefully,
          reduce attachment to anything. Wealth, status, family, and so on, it
          doesn't mean you can't be close to them. Who says you can't be close?
          The key is not to be attached. Being attached means being dependent,
          usually tested with phrases like "if not." "If not for you, my life
          would be in darkness," "If not for this MacBook, I can't work," "If
          not for smoking, my mind feels dizzy, smoking makes me feel calm."
          These are signs of dependency. Once there are words like "if not," it
          means you are dependent, there is possession there and you have the
          potential to feel disappointed, to feel loss, and to feel fear, all of
          it combined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leonardo da Vinci said,
          <em>He who possesses most must be most afraid of loss</em>. Therefore,
          those most anxious about losing wealth are the rich, the rich are more
          afraid of losing their money. Meanwhile, those who have little have
          less fear, what would they fear losing if they have nothing? Hence, do
          not be easily dependent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>He who thinks little errs much</em>: All this time, we have
          believed that thinking too much leads to many mistakes. This is not
          true. According to Leonardo, it is quite the opposite; if you rarely
          think, you will often make mistakes. Why is that? Because you are not
          practiced in thinking. So, it is fine if you think incorrectly; it can
          be corrected later. If you make a mistake, it can be fixed. Keep
          thinking, don't worry; eventually, you will become skilled in critical
          thinking and thinking correctly. If you rarely think, your mind is
          seldom used, meaning you are still prone to err in your thinking.
          Therefore, do not be afraid to think, because those who think little
          actually have a greater potential for making mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>He who truly knows has no occasion to shout</em>: Anyone who truly
          knows the truth does not feel the need to shout. Those who are still
          noisy about their truth usually do not fully believe in it themselves.
          People who are preoccupied with pointing out others' mistakes often
          doubt themselves and seek to assert their own correctness. If someone
          still needs to assert their own correctness, it actually means they
          are not entirely confident in their own truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, when you know the truth, you are calm and not
          argumentative. "You can say whatever you want, I already know what the
          absolute truth is." However, if you are still argumentative, still
          eager to identify others' mistakes, it usually means you still need
          justification for your own truth, which lies in others' errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we must be cautious with the truth we hold, as sometimes we
          become preoccupied with finding others' faults. This is a sign that we
          are not fully confident in our own truth. If we are truly confident in
          our truth, we no longer need to prove that others are more wrong than
          we are, that others are mistaken and we are the only ones who are
          right. This is one of Leonardo's principles: those who are still noisy
          in seeking out who is wrong are likely not entirely confident in their
          own truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the tradition of Islamic philosophy (<em>Ilm al-kalam</em>), there
          is a term "sukunun nafs" (tranquility of the soul). One of the
          parameters of truth is sukunun nafs. When you have reached the
          terminal of truth, your soul is at peace because you know what is
          absolute.
